# sayHello
This is a website that displays current time, local weather, and your to-do list. It also says hi to you! I made this using javascript, html, and css. Used one external API from OpenWeatherMap.

Here are some screenshots of this website!!

This is the initial screen that you will see.

You can see your current local time and weather. Once you type in your name, the website will say hi to you!

You can also make a to-do list by typing in your tasks!

Are you done typing in your tasks?

You can also delete the tasks that you have completed, by clickingg on the button next to the task.

Also, as you can see, the background image will change when you refresh the site. Oh and don't worry about losing your to-do list when you refresh the site. Your to-do list is saved in a local storage and will not disappear!
